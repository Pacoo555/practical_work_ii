                <h2>Overview of computer engineering</h2>
                <p>The Computer Engineering degree provides a solid foundation in hardware and software, giving students a comprehensive understanding of how computers function and interact. The program aims to equip students with the technical expertise, analytical skills, and innovative mindset to design, develop, and maintain advanced computing solutions. It also incorporates studies in ethics and critical thinking to address the societal impact of technology.</p>

                <h2>Subjects</h2>
                    <p>- Fundamentals of Computer Engineering: This subject serves as an introduction to everything related to computers, including stuides of both hardware and software, but also with a bit of history.</p>
                    <p>- Discrete Mathematics: This type of maths help us understand how computers work, ranging from fields such as logic, to graph theory or algorithms.</p>
                    <p>- Engineering Mathematics: This type of maths focuses on linear algebra, which is a branch of mathematics that focuses on the study of vector spaces and linear transformations between them. It deals with concepts such as vectors, matrices, systems of linear equations, and the properties and operations associated with them.</p>
                    <p>- Introduction to programming: This subject serves as an introduction to C, dealing with variables, functions and pointers.</p>
                    <p>- Logic and critical thinking: This subject isn't as focused on engineering as others, it helps us think reasonably on various topics, not related with computer science or mathematics.</p>
                    <p>- Knowledge management and personal skills: This is a global subject every degree has at UFV, it is a humanistic subject that helps us become a better version of ourselves.</p>
                    <p>This are all the subjecs we had on the first semester of the Computer Engineering degree. Below there is an in depth description of the Fundamentals of Computer Engineering subject.</p>
