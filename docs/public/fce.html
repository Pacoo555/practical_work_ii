                <h2>Introduction to Fundamentals of Computer Engineering</h2>
                <p>FCE covers essential topics in computer engineering, beginning with the history of computer science and moving towards the latest advancements in artificial intelligence and big data. It starts by examining key historical milestones, including Alan Turing's contributions and the progression of computers through various generations.
                    FCE also covers software development, focusing on Operating systems, methodologies, and programming languages. It also explores hardware architecture, including the computer's structure, memory, and bus organization.
                    FCE also studies the evolution of computer networks, focusing on the Internet's architecture, protocols, and addressing systems. It also covers important concepts like data, information and numerical systems, such as binary. Finally, it addresses the legal and ethical issues in computer engineering and examines new trends such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and the Internet of Things.</p>

                <h2>Practical assignments</h2>
                <p>- The first practical assignment was creating a document about a chose topic, in my case, about generative AI in video. Then, we had to create a presentation and we expose it.</p>
                <p>- The second practical work consists of this website.</p>
