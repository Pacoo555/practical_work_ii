## Design Detailed Document
### Description of the Work
This project involves creating a basic HTML web page that provides information about me. The website has seven different HTML files: index serves as a home page, degree develops everything about Computer Engineering, fce provides information about Fundamentals of Computer Engineering, about has information about me, net has links to my partner's pages, topic provides information about generative AI in video generation and contact.


### Problems During Development
One of the primary challenges I encountered was understanding how to use relative paths to correctly link to the other pages on the site. Initially, the navigation links did not point to the intended files, which led to some confusion. Resolving this issue required multiple tests and adjustments, along with some trial and error, before the links functioned as expected. Ultimately, I was able to resolve the problem successfully.

Another issue was trying to insert a link into an image. I wanted the image to be clickable, but I couldnâ€™t figure out the correct way to combine the <a> and <img> tags. After searching online for examples and testing different approaches, I eventually managed to make it work, but it took longer than expected.

### Conclusion
Developing this page was a valuable learning experience, as it allowed me to gain a better understanding of how web pages are structured and how different HTML elements interact. Although I encountered some initial challenges, I was ultimately able to create a functional page that demonstrates the knowledge I have gained.
